            <p claas="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                empathy, and complex vocational skills</p>

            <p claas="sectionsubtag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.</p>

            <p claas="sectionsubtag text-small">Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
                policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.
                State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools
                and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and
                proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of schools offering elementary
                education (Grades 1–8) were managed by government and 16.86% of schools were under private management
                (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the Education Guarantee Scheme
                and in alternative learning centers). Of those schools managed privately, one third are 'aided' and two
                thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment in Grades 1–8 is shared between government and privately managed schools
                in the ratio 73:27. However in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in urban areas much lower
                (36:66</p>
